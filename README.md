# 🚢 Titanic Insight Dashboard & Survival Prediction

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** and **Machine Learning model** built to analyze and predict passenger survival on the Titanic.  
This project combines data visualization with predictive analytics to explore how features like age, class, fare, and family size affected survival.  
The design uses a dark, ocean-inspired theme reflecting the Titanic’s atmosphere 🌊.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard offers clear and interactive visuals about:
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family & Survival Sums by Fare and Class**
- ⚰️ **Count of Passengers by Age and Survival**
- 🚻 **Age Distribution by Sex**
- 🎟️ **Passenger Class Distribution**
- 📈 **Passenger Count by Age and Class**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

A **classification model** was built to predict which passengers were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster.  
### 🔍 Model Details:
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Target Variable:** `Survived`  
- **Key Features:** `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare_log`, `FamilySize`, `Embarked`, `Title`, `Deck`  
- **Performance Metric:** Accuracy & Cross-Validation Score  

The model helps understand the most important survival factors, bridging analytics with predictive insight.
